<h3>UVM basic test bench for APB: </h3>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a basic UVM test bench environment for APB protocol and develop a tutorial for developing UVM basic test bench </p>
<h3>Entry Access Enabling Touch Screen System:</h3>
<p>Our project is a part of real time Entry enabling security system. It is an entry access enabling system consisting of a 3.2‚Äù 16bit TFT color touchscreen by connecting it to Tiva launch pad. A greeting message and a keypad is displayed on it. User enters valid ID followed by a 
Password through the keypad displayed. Access would be granted to a valid combination of id and password.			                                                             
 Modules Used: ADC, Timer, Touch screen.

<h3>Design of 64x32 SRAM using 90nm CMOS Technology:</h3>
<p>In this project a 64x32 cache memory was designed in 90nm CMOS technology using Synopsys custom designer. We started from Top-level architecture describing the blocks required like SRAM array, controller, and sense amplifier, read and write buffer, Decoder. Developed schematics with suitable sizing of transistor followed by physical design and then  DRC & LVS check individual and top-level  and ended up having Area of 32Um2 static power  257uW Dynamic power @500Mhz 6.05mW</p>
<h3>Fixed Block Size Motion Estimator using Verilog coding :</h3>
<p>The objective of the project is to use Motion estimation using bandwidth compression method. It is a part of predictive coding used in latest hybrid video coding standards such as H.261 and MPEG. This circuit consists of a Controller, Memory, Processing Element, and Comparator. The code for these blocks were written and tested as a part of this project. Prepared Report, Power point Presentation & test results. </p>
